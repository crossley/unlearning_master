Dear colleague, 

Please find attached our manuscript titled "Detection of Feedback Contingency Depends on Declarative Systems", coauthored with W. Todd Maddox and F. Gregory Ashby. The work reported within attempts to identity the factors that determine why and how procedural knowledge can be so resistant to change. Our previous work identified feedback contingency as a key driver in this process, and the present work shows that the computation of feedback contingency is reliant on declarative systems. 

I hope you enjoy the read.

Sincerely, 

Matthew Crossley, PhD
