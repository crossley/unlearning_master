# Scalar activation TANs models

## Installation
Nothing really. Just be sure python is installed. I'm using
2.7.11. Also be sure you have all the dependencies in
*experiment_imports.py* installed.

## Usage
Run *inspect_models.py* to simulate models, and play around
with *inspect_results.py* and *inspect_results.R* to inspect
simulation results.
