For instance, accuracy during acquisition in condition 3 was higher than it was in condition 1 or 2.  Accuracy during intervention was higher in condition 3 than it was in conditions 1 or 2. Accuracy in condition 4 was higher than condition 1 during intervention. Accuracy in conditions 3 and 4 were higher than in conditions 1 and 2 during reacquisition. However, note that none of these result will have any effect on our within-condition estimate of savings.
