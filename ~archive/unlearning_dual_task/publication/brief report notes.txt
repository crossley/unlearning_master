L&M: Brief Communications are high-quality complete yet shorter bodies of work that provide compelling, novel, and important conclusions. Brief Communications may be more restricted in breadth of analysis or cover a more defined area of a particular field, but the work must still be of interest to a broad range of researchers. Manuscripts must be less than 2500 words and contain no section headings. The word limit is exclusive of abstract, literature cited and figure legends. Abstracts should contain less than 100 words. There is a limit of 3 figures.

PB&R: Brief Reports are restricted to a maximum of 4,000 words. This word count includes the main text, appendixes, footnotes, and references but excludes title page, abstract, figures, and tables. Authors of Brief Reports should be sparing with regard to figures and tables. Despite their short length, Brief Reports are expected to make substantial contributions to new knowledge and to be of broad interest to the general readership of the journal.
