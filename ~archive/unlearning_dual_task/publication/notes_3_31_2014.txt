3 moving parts: 
- Dual-task length 
- Dual-task onset
- Intervention length

1) Get clear on whether we have savings in the control condition or not
2) Look at the effect of dual-task on conditions with established savings (300 Intervention trials)
3) Explore dual-task onset more systematically

The current data stand out with a few key features:
1) Dual-task slows shifts in strategy when onset precedes Int (Conditions 1-3)
2) Brief improvement in strategy application when dual-task turns off in Conditions 2 & 3 but not 4
3) Dual-task seems to prevent strategy shifts altogether when onset follows Int (Condition 4)
4) Condition 4 and Condition 5 are allegedly identical up to block 16, why the huge difference?
5) There is a very clear interference in Condition 3


*** Conditions 1 through 4 might have received mixed feedback. Waiting on Todd to check ***
